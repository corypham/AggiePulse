AggiePulse: Navigating UC Davis, One Pulse at a Time

AggiePulse is an innovative platform designed to enhance the UC Davis community experience by providing real-time insights into campus life. Born out of the day-to-day experiences of a UC Davis student actively engaged in campus life, AggiePulse is a testament to the belief that informed decisions can enhance the university experience. From squeezing in workouts at the gym, seeking quiet study spaces in the library, to finding the best coffee spots for a much-needed break, the idea for AggiePulse stemmed from a simple yet powerful need: to have real-time information about campus places at your fingertips.
