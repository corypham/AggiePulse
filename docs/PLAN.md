Step-by-Step Guide
Define Requirements and Features:

Core Features:
User authentication and authorization.
Geofencing to detect when users enter or leave the campus.
Real-time occupancy data of campus locations.
User ratings and reviews of campus locations.
Optional Features:
Notifications for users when they are near a busy location.
Integration with campus services (e.g., library, dining hall).
Choose Technologies:

Frontend:
React Native: A popular framework for building mobile apps using React. It allows for code sharing between iOS and Android.
Backend:
Django: A high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design.
Django REST Framework (DRF): For building RESTful APIs to communicate with the frontend.
Database:
PostgreSQL: A powerful, open-source relational database.
Geolocation and Geofencing:
Google Maps API: For geolocation services and geofencing.
Firebase: Can be used for real-time database needs and push notifications.
Set Up the Development Environment:

Install React Native:
bash
Copy code
npm install -g expo-cli
expo init AggiePulse
cd AggiePulse
npm start
Set up Django and DRF:
bash
Copy code
pip install django djangorestframework
django-admin startproject aggiepulse
cd aggiepulse
django-admin startapp api
Develop the Frontend (React Native):

Create screens for login, dashboard, location details, and user profile.
Implement geolocation features using the react-native-geolocation-service library.
Set up push notifications using Firebase.
Develop the Backend (Django + DRF):

Set up user models and authentication.
Create API endpoints for fetching location data, user reviews, and occupancy data.
Implement geofencing logic to track user locations within the campus area.
Integrate Frontend and Backend:

Use Axios or Fetch API in React Native to make API calls to the Django backend.
Ensure secure communication between the app and backend (consider using HTTPS).
Testing:

Test the app on both iOS and Android devices/emulators.
Ensure that geofencing works accurately and that notifications are timely.
Deployment:

Backend: Deploy the Django backend on a cloud platform like Heroku, AWS, or Google Cloud.
Mobile App: Use Expo or React Native CLI to build the app for both iOS and Android.
iOS: Use App Store Connect to publish the app on the Apple App Store.
Android: Use Google Play Console to publish the app on Google Play Store.
Popular Technologies for App Development
React Native: For cross-platform mobile app development.
Django + DRF: For backend API development using Python.
Firebase: For real-time database, push notifications, and analytics.
PostgreSQL: As the primary relational database.
Docker: For containerizing the application to ensure consistent environments.
Launching the App
Beta Testing:

Use platforms like TestFlight for iOS and Google Play Beta for Android to test the app with a group of users.
Collect feedback and fix bugs.
Marketing:

Create a marketing plan to promote the app among UC Davis students.
Use social media, email campaigns, and posters around campus.
Launch:

Publish the app on the respective app stores.
Monitor user feedback and usage metrics using tools like Firebase Analytics.
Post-Launch:

Regularly update the app with new features and improvements based on user feedback.
Scale the backend infrastructure as the number of users grows.
By following these steps and using the mentioned technologies, you can efficiently develop, launch, and maintain the AggiePulse app.
